## Introduction of how to reproduce the result in the above study using the files in this repository.

### A_Github_2012-2020_List_of_2685_Articles_with_Manual_Extracted_Data.xlsx
*This is the raw data manually extracted from each of the 2685 included literatures in this bibliometric study. The excel is used to produce the correlation items for clustering and heat map construction.*

### B_Items derived from A for HeatMap.xlsx
*Derived from the raw data in **Excel A.** to store the correlation of the items for heat map and clustering.*

### DLnetworks.xlsx
*List of the 47 deep learning networks we summerized in this stduy.*

### Tasks.xlsx
*Eight radiological tasks for deep learning-based studies.*

### DL_Statistics.R
*The source code for statistics of the correlation in items in **Excel B.** in this reposiory.*

### Statistics_of_Samples.R
*Based on the manually extracted sample size of each included literature, the code in this file is used for the statistics of the sample size and types.*
